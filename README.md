## Why am I uploading this?  
I want to showcase some of my **foundational AI training**.  
To that end, I included the excellent scores I received on assignments (see `.png` screenshots).

## Whatâ€™s in this repo?  
- Only the **computational projects** assigned every two weeks.  
- The notebooks are included **in the original form** I received them.  
- **No solutions are published.**  

Why?  
These assignments are still being handed out in the new versions of the course. Were I to publish the solutions, new students of CS4780-5780 could find the solved assignments. This would violate Cornell's academic ethical requirements.
